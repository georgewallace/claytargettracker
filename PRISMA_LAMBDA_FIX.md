# 🔧 Prisma AWS Lambda Binary Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Error**: 
```
Prisma Client could not locate the Query Engine for runtime "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"
```

**Root Cause**: Prisma was only generating binaries for your local machine, not for AWS Lambda's Linux environment.

## 🎯 Solution Applied

### Changed File: `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Before**:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

**After**:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]
}
```

### What This Does:
- `"native"` - Generates binary for your local machine (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- `"rhel-openssl-3.0.x"` - Generates binary for AWS Lambda (Red Hat Enterprise Linux with OpenSSL 3.0)

## ✅ Verification

Both binaries are now generated:
```bash
✓ libquery_engine-darwin-arm64.dylib.node (your Mac)
✓ libquery_engine-rhel-openssl-3.0.x.so.node (AWS Lambda)
```

## 🚀 Deploy Now

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add prisma/schema.prisma
git commit -m "Fix Prisma binaries for AWS Lambda deployment"
```

### Step 2: Push to Deploy
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Wait for Build
- AWS Amplify will automatically rebuild
- Build time: ~3-5 minutes
- Prisma will include the correct binary this time

## 📊 What Will Happen

During the Amplify build:
1. ✅ `npx prisma generate` runs
2. ✅ Generates BOTH binaries
3. ✅ Packages the AWS Lambda binary in deployment
4. ✅ Your app starts successfully
5. ✅ Database queries work!

## 🎉 Expected Result

After redeployment:
- ✅ App loads without errors
- ✅ Tournaments display on home page
- ✅ Can create account
- ✅ Can login
- ✅ Database operations work

## 💡 Why This Happened

Prisma's default behavior is to only generate binaries for your current platform. When deploying to AWS Lambda (which runs on Linux), we need to explicitly tell Prisma to also generate the Linux binary.

This is a common issue when deploying Prisma apps to:
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Amplify
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Any serverless platform

## 📝 Important Notes

### Keep This Configuration
Always keep `binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]` in your schema. This ensures:
- Local development works (native)
- AWS deployment works (rhel-openssl-3.0.x)

### If You Change Platforms
If you deploy to a different platform in the future, you may need different targets:
- **Vercel**: `["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]`
- **Netlify**: `["native", "rhel-openssl-1.1.x"]` 
- **Google Cloud Run**: `["native", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]`
- **Azure**: `["native", "linux-musl"]`

For now, AWS Lambda needs `rhel-openssl-3.0.x`. ✅

## 🆘 If This Doesn't Fix It

If you still get Prisma errors after deployment:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Make sure you see "Generated Prisma Client" in the logs
2. **Check File Size**: The AWS Lambda binary should be ~17MB
3. **Try Clean Build**: In Amplify Console, go to Build settings → Clear cache → Rebuild

## ✅ Success Checklist

After deployment:
- [ ] No Prisma errors in CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Home page loads
- [ ] Tournaments display
- [ ] Can sign up
- [ ] Can login
- [ ] Can create tournament (coach/admin)
