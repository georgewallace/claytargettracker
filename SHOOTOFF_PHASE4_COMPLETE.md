## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching:

```typescript
const shootOff = await prisma.shootOff.findUnique({
  where: { id: shootOffId },
  include: {
    tournament: true,
    discipline: true,
    participants: {
      include: {
        shooter: {
          include: {
            user: true,
            team: true
          }
        },
        scores: {
          include: {
            round: true
          }
        }
      }
    },
    rounds: {
      include: {
        scores: {
          include: {
            participant: {
              include: {
                shooter: {
                  include: {
                    user: true
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    winner: {
      include: {
        user: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Permission Checks:

```typescript
const isAdmin = user.role === 'admin' || tournament.createdById === user.id
const canManage = user.role === 'admin' || tournament.createdById === user.id
```

### State Management:

```typescript
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
const [error, setError] = useState('')
const [success, setSuccess] = useState('')

// API call with error handling
const handleStartShootOff = async () => {
  setLoading(true)
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/.../start`, { method: 'POST' })
    const data = await response.json()
    if (!response.ok) {
      setError(data.error)
    } else {
      setSuccess('Started!')
      router.refresh()
    }
  } catch (err) {
    setError('Error occurred')
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Score Entry** - Not yet implemented (Phase 5)
   - Rounds can be created
   - But scores must be entered manually in database
   - Score entry UI coming in Phase 5

2. **Winner Declaration** - Not yet implemented (Phase 5)
   - System detects when ready (1 participant left)
   - But winner must be declared via API/database
   - Declaration UI coming in Phase 5

3. **Real-Time Updates** - Requires page refresh
   - Using `router.refresh()` after actions
   - No WebSocket/SSE for live updates
   - Could be enhanced in future

4. **Elimination Logic** - Not yet automated
   - Participants manually marked as eliminated
   - Automatic elimination coming in Phase 5

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Score Entry & Round Management

Need to implement:
1. **Score Entry Page** - `/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/rounds/[roundId]/scores`
   - Form to enter targets hit for each participant
   - Validation (0 to max targets)
   - Submit and mark round complete
   - Auto-elimination logic

2. **Winner Declaration Page** - `/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/declare-winner`
   - Confirm winner
   - Set final placements for all participants
   - Mark shoot-off as completed
   - Update leaderboard

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - POST `/api/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/rounds/[roundId]/scores`
   - POST `/api/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/declare-winner`

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

## Progress Update

- ✅ **Phase 1:** Database Schema (Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Tournament Settings UI (Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 3:** Tie Detection & Creation (Complete)
- ✅ **Phase 4:** Management Interface (Complete) ← **JUST FINISHED!**
- ⏳ **Phase 5:** Score Entry & Winner Declaration (Next - 3-4 hours)
