## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema Changes**

Added `logoUrl` field to the Team model:
```prisma
model Team {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  logoUrl   String?  // NEW - URL/path to team logo
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  
  coaches      TeamCoach[]
  shooters     Shooter[]
  joinRequests TeamJoinRequest[]
}
```

### 2. **Team Logo Component** (`components/TeamLogo.tsx`)

Reusable component that displays team logos with fallback:
- Shows team logo if available
- Shows team initial in colored circle if no logo
- Supports 5 sizes: xs, sm, md, lg, xl
- Consistent styling throughout app

### 3. **Logo Upload Interface** (`app/teams/my-team/TeamLogoUpload.tsx`)

Client component for uploading/removing team logos:
- Preview uploaded logo
- Drag-and-drop or click to upload
- File validation (type, size)
- Remove logo functionality
- Real-time preview
- Error handling

### 4. **API Endpoints** (`app/api/teams/[id]/logo/route.ts`)

**POST** `/api/teams/[id]/logo`
- Upload team logo
- Validates file type and size
- Stores in `public/uploads/teams/`
- Updates database with logo URL

**DELETE** `/api/teams/[id]/logo`
- Removes team logo
- Sets logoUrl to null in database

---

## üìç Where Team Logos Appear

### ‚úÖ Implemented Locations

1. **Team Management Page** (`/teams/my-team`)
   - Upload section with preview
   - Large logo display (xl size)

2. **Tournament Detail Page** (`/tournaments/[id]`)
   - Registration list
   - Small logo next to each shooter (sm size)

3. **Tournament Leaderboards** (`/tournaments/[id]/leaderboard`)
   - Data structure includes teamLogoUrl
   - Ready for display in leaderboard components

4. **Squad Management**
   - Team logo data available for squads
   - Can be displayed when squad is full team

## üé® Team Logo Component

### Usage

```tsx
import TeamLogo from '@/components/TeamLogo'

<TeamLogo 
  logoUrl={team.logoUrl}
  teamName={team.name}
  size="md"
/>
```

### Props

- `logoUrl`: string | null - URL to team logo
- `teamName`: string - Team name (for fallback initial)
- `size`: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl' (default: 'md')

| md   | 48x48px    | Standard display |
| lg   | 64x64px    | Prominent display |
| xl   | 96x96px    | Upload preview, team page header |

### Fallback Design
