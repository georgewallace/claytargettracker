# Disciplines Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### Database Schema Changes

**New Models:**
1. **Discipline** - The four clay target disciplines
   - Sporting Clays
   - 5-Stand
   - Skeet
   - Trap

2. **TournamentDiscipline** - Many-to-many: Tournaments ‚Üî Disciplines
   - Tournaments can offer 1 or all 4 disciplines

3. **RegistrationDiscipline** - Tracks which disciplines each shooter registers for
   - Shooters choose disciplines when registering
   - Tracks who assigned them (coach or self-selected)

4. **Shoot** - Individual shooting session (replaces old Score model)
   - Links: Tournament + Shooter + Discipline
   - Historical record of all shoots
   - One Shoot can have multiple Scores (stations)

5. **Score** - Individual station scores
   - Now belongs to a Shoot (not directly to Tournament)
   - Enables historical tracking across tournaments

### Key Relationships

```
Tournament
  ‚îî‚îÄ TournamentDiscipline (which disciplines offered)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Registration (shooters registered)
      ‚îî‚îÄ RegistrationDiscipline (which disciplines per shooter)
          ‚îî‚îÄ Shoot (actual shooting session)
              ‚îî‚îÄ Score (station-by-station scores)
```

### What This Enables

**For Shooters:**
- Register for specific disciplines only
- Track performance history across all tournaments
- View discipline-specific statistics

**For Coaches:**
- Assign shooters to specific disciplines
- Manage team across multiple disciplines
- Track team performance by discipline

**For Tournaments:**
- Offer 1, 2, 3, or all 4 disciplines
- Separate leaderboards per discipline
- More flexible tournament structures

## üöß What Needs to Be Updated

### 1. Tournament Creation (TODO)
- Add discipline checkboxes to tournament creation form
- Update API to handle discipline selection
- Default to all disciplines if none selected

### 2. Registration System (TODO)
**Shooter Self-Registration:**
- Show available disciplines for tournament
- Let shooter choose which disciplines
- Create RegistrationDiscipline entries

**Coach Bulk Registration:**
- Select shooters AND disciplines
- Option to register for all or specific disciplines
- Track that coach assigned them

### 3. Score Entry (TODO)
- Update to use Shoot model
- Select discipline before entering scores
- Create Shoot record, then Score records

### 4. Leaderboards (TODO)
- Filter by discipline
- Show discipline tabs
- Aggregate scores per discipline

### 5. Shooter History (TODO)
- View all shoots across tournaments
- Filter by discipline
- Statistics and trends

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- [x] Database schema migrated
- [x] Four disciplines seeded
- [x] Relations established
- [x] Prisma client regenerated

### üöß In Progress:
These need to be implemented for the system to work with new schema:

**Critical (breaks current functionality):**
- [ ] Update tournament creation for disciplines
- [ ] Update registration to use new schema
- [ ] Update score entry to use Shoot model
- [ ] Update leaderboards to query Shoots

**Important (new features):**
- [ ] Discipline selection UI for shooters
- [ ] Coach discipline assignment interface
- [ ] Shooter history page
- [ ] Discipline-specific statistics

## üîß Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 - Fix Existing Features (CRITICAL)
1. Update tournament APIs to work with disciplines
2. Update registration to create RegistrationDiscipline
3. Update score entry to create Shoot + Scores
4. Update leaderboards to query from Shoots

### Phase 2 - Add Discipline Selection
5. Tournament creation with discipline checkboxes
6. Registration with discipline selection
7. Coach interface for discipline assignment

### Phase 3 - Enhanced Features
8. Shooter history and statistics
9. Discipline-specific leaderboards
10. Performance analytics

## üéØ Quick Start to Fix

The application is currently broken because the schema changed but the code still references the old structure. Here's what needs immediate attention:

1. **Score Entry** - Currently tries to create Score directly, needs to create Shoot first
2. **Leaderboards** - Queries scores from Tournament, needs to query from Shoots
3. **Registration** - Works but doesn't create RegistrationDiscipline entries yet

## üìù Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Fix existing features first** - Make tournaments, registration, and scores work with new schema
2. **Implement discipline selection** - Add UI for choosing disciplines
3. **Both** - Fix critical issues then add discipline features

The system has been migrated to support disciplines, but the application code needs to be updated to use the new structure.
