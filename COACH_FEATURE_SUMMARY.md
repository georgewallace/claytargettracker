The coach registration system has been successfully implemented, allowing both shooters to self-register and coaches to bulk register multiple shooters for tournaments.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. User Role System
- **Enhanced user model** with three roles:
  - `shooter`: Default role, can self-register and compete
  - `coach`: Can bulk register shooters, cannot compete
  - `admin`: Full permissions (future use)

### 2. Updated Signup Process
- **Role selection dropdown** during signup
- **Conditional shooter profile** creation (only for shooters)
- **Role descriptions** to help users choose correctly
- **Validation** to ensure valid roles

### 3. Bulk Registration API

  - Skips duplicates automatically

### 4. Coach Registration Interface
- **Beautiful UI component** on tournament pages
- **Search functionality**:
  - Search by name, email, or team
  - Real-time filtering
  - Case-insensitive
- **Bulk selection**:
  - Select All button
  - Clear button
  - Selection counter
- **Smart filtering**:
  - Hides already registered shooters
  - Shows only available shooters
- **Status messages**:
  - Success notifications
  - Error handling
  - Loading states

### 5. Visual Enhancements

- **Conditional display** of coach panel
- **Responsive design** for mobile/tablet
- **Professional styling** matching app theme

### 6. Security & Permissions

## Use Cases Supported

### ✅ Youth Team Coach
- Register entire team for tournaments
- Search by team name
- Track team performance

### ✅ Club Administrator
- Bulk register pre-registered shooters
- Mix coach and self-registration
- Manage multiple tournaments

### ✅ Individual Shooter
- Self-register independently

- Compete without team affiliation

## API Reference

### Bulk Registration
```http
POST /api/registrations/bulk
Authorization: Required (Coach/Admin)
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tournamentId": "string",
  "shooterIds": ["string", "string", ...]
}

Response:
{
  "message": "Successfully registered X shooter(s)",
  "registered": number,
  "alreadyRegistered": number,
  "total": number
}
```

### Self Registration
```http
POST /api/registrations
Authorization: Required (Shooter)
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tournamentId": "string",
  "shooterId": "string"
}

Response:
{
  "id": "string",
  "tournamentId": "string",
  "shooterId": "string",
  "status": "registered",
  "createdAt": "datetime"
}
```

## Database Schema

```prisma
model User {
  role String @default("shooter") // shooter, coach, admin
  // Only shooters get a shooter profile
  shooter Shooter?
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Validation**: Backend validates role on every request
2. **Authorization**: Coaches can only bulk register, not modify scores
3. **Ownership**: Shooters can only self-register their own profile
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Database constraints prevent duplicates
5. **Session Management**: All actions require valid session

## Performance

- ✅ Efficient database queries
- ✅ Indexed lookups
- ✅ Minimal API calls
- ✅ Client-side filtering for search
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Coach dashboard with analytics
- [ ] Unregister shooters
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] CSV import for bulk registration
- [ ] Coach can view shooter scores
- [ ] Registration approval workflow
