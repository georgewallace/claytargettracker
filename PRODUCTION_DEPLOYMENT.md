# Production Deployment Guide

## âœ… Status: Code Deployed to Main Branch

The code has been merged from staging to main and pushed to GitHub. AWS Amplify will automatically build and deploy to production.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Steps to Complete Production Deployment

### 1. Wait for AWS Amplify Build

1. Go to your AWS Amplify console
2. Select your app (main branch)
3. Wait for the build to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)
4. Verify the build succeeds

### 2. Get Your Production Database URL

You need your production database URL from Neon.tech or your database provider.

**Format:**
```
postgresql://username:password@host/database?sslmode=require
```

### 3. Copy Data from Staging to Production

Once you have your production database URL, run:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export STAGING_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_cmYpQBg2e8NM@ep-wispy-hall-a4g4c6su-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require"
export PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url-here"

# Run the copy script
npx tsx scripts/copy-staging-to-production.ts
```

### 4. Verify Production

After the data is copied:

1. Visit your production URL
2. Verify all tournaments are visible
3. Test key features:
   - Squad management
   - Auto-assign squads
   - Leaderboards
   - Shooter profiles
   - Team history
