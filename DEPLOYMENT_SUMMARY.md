# 🚀 AWS Amplify Deployment - All Issues Fixed!

## ✅ All 3 Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Prisma Config ❌ → ✅
**Error**: `Cannot find module 'prisma/config'`
**Fix**: Deleted `prisma.config.ts` (optional file causing conflicts)

### Issue 2: Tailwind CSS ❌ → ✅
**Error**: `Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'`
**Fix**: Moved to `dependencies`

### Issue 3: TypeScript Types ❌ → ✅
**Error**: `TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed`
**Fix**: Moved all TypeScript packages to `dependencies`

---

## 📦 What Changed in package.json

### Moved to `dependencies`:
- ✅ `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- ✅ `tailwindcss`
- ✅ `prisma`
- ✅ `typescript`
- ✅ `@types/bcrypt`
- ✅ `@types/node`
- ✅ `@types/react`
- ✅ `@types/react-dom`

### Remaining in `devDependencies`:
- `eslint`
- `eslint-config-next`

**Why this matters**: AWS Amplify needs build-time packages in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`.
