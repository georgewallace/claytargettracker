# 🎯 Squad Auto-Assign Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the improvements made to the squad auto-assignment system, including better validation, detailed feedback, and flexible options.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Enhanced Auto-Assign Options**

**Default Settings Changed:**
- `deleteExistingSquads`: Now **unchecked by default** (was checked)
- Preserves existing squads unless explicitly requested

**New Options Added:**
- ✅ **Include shooters without teams** - Assign shooters who aren't on a team
- ✅ **Include shooters without divisions** - Assign shooters who don't have a division set

**Existing Options:**
- ✅ Keep teams together
- ✅ Keep divisions together  
- ✅ Keep teams close in time
- ✅ Delete existing squads

### 2. **Detailed Failure Reporting**

When shooters can't be assigned, you now get specific reasons:

**Reasons Tracked:**
- ⏰ Time conflict with other assignments
- 🔒 All available squads are team-only for different teams
- 📊 Squad at this time slot is full (X/Y capacity)
- 🏟️ Field already has a squad (Trap specific)
- 🚫 Only one squad allowed per time slot (5-Stand/Skeet)
- 📍 No available time slots
- 💺 No squads with enough capacity

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully assigned 15 shooters to squads. 3 shooters could not be assigned.",
  "assignmentsMade": 15,
  "hasUnassigned": true,
  "unassignedShooters": {
    "Trap": [
      {
        "shooterName": "John Doe",
        "teamName": "Team A",
        "reason": "Squad at this time slot is full (5/5)"
      }
    ],
    "Skeet": [
      {
        "shooterName": "Jane Smith",
        "teamName": "Team B",
        "reason": "Time conflict with other assignments"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. **Team-Only Squad Protection**

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Auto-assign now respects `teamOnly` flag on squads
- ✅ Won't add shooters from different teams to team-only squads
- ✅ Creates new squads when team-only restrictions prevent assignment

### 4. **Strict Discipline Rules Enforcement**

**5-Stand & Skeet:**
- ✅ Only ONE squad per time slot (strictly enforced)
- ✅ Won't create second squad even if first is full
- ✅ Moves to next time slot instead

**Trap:**
- ✅ Only ONE squad per field per time slot
- ✅ Multiple fields can have squads at same time

**Sporting Clays:**
- ✅ Multiple squads allowed per time slot

### 5. **UI/UX Improvements**

**Modals Converted:**
- ✅ Remove shooter from squad - now a modal (was popup)
- ✅ Delete squad - now a modal (was popup)
- ✅ Auto-assign confirmation - enhanced modal with options

**Field Selection:**
- ✅ "Add Time Slot" now uses dropdown for field selection (was text input)
- ✅ Auto-populates with existing fields from the discipline

**Squad Renaming:**
- ✅ Click pencil icon to rename inline
- ✅ Validates unique names within discipline
- ✅ Enter to save, Escape to cancel

### 6. **Date/Time Consistency**

**Fixed Timezone Issues:**
- ✅ All dates now display consistently across pages
- ✅ Squad management page shows correct tournament dates
- ✅ Time slot filtering works correctly
- ✅ No more off-by-one-day errors

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Frontend (`SquadManager.tsx`)
- Added `includeShootersWithoutTeams` and `includeShootersWithoutDivisions` options
- Changed `deleteExistingSquads` default to `false`
- Updated modal UI with new toggle options
- Improved date handling using ISO string comparison

### Backend (`auto-assign-squads/route.ts`)
- Added detailed failure reason tracking per shooter
- Enhanced team-only squad validation
- Improved discipline-specific rule enforcement
- Dynamic shooter filtering based on team/division options
- Comprehensive error messages in response

### Squad Card (`SquadCard.tsx`)
- Converted remove shooter confirmation to modal
- Converted delete squad confirmation to modal
- Added inline squad renaming with validation
- Enhanced visual feedback

### Time Slot Section (`TimeSlotSection.tsx`)
- Removed "+ Add Squad" button and form
- Squads now only created via drag-and-drop
- Cleaner, simpler interface

## 📊 Auto-Assign Logic Flow

```
1. Parse options from request
2. Filter shooters based on team/division options
3. Conditionally delete existing squads (if requested)
4. Group shooters by discipline, then by team/division
5. For each group:
   a. Check time conflicts
   b. Check squad capacity
   c. Check team-only restrictions
   d. Check discipline-specific rules
   e. Find suitable squad or create new one
   f. Track failures with specific reasons
6. Return detailed results with unassigned shooter info
```
