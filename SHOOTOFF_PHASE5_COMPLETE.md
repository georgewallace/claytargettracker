# Shoot-Off System - Phase 5 Complete ✅

## Summary

**Phase 5: Score Entry & Winner Declaration** has been successfully implemented! Admins can now enter scores for each round, automatically eliminate participants based on format, and declare winners when shoot-offs are complete.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Score Entry Page

**Path:** `/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/rounds/[roundId]/scores/page.tsx`

Server component that loads round data and validates permissions.

**Features:**
- ✅ Authentication & permission checks
- ✅ Validates round exists and is not completed
- ✅ Loads active participants only (non-eliminated)
- ✅ Shows configuration (max targets, format)
- ✅ Prevents double-scoring (completed rounds)
- ✅ Clear instructions for admins

### 2. Score Entry Form Component

**Path:** `ScoreEntryForm.tsx`

Interactive client component for entering scores.

**Features:**
- ✅ Individual score input for each participant
- ✅ +/- buttons for easy adjustment
- ✅ Direct number input
- ✅ Range validation (0 to max targets)
- ✅ Quick fill buttons (set all to same value)
- ✅ Shooter info display (name, team, original score)
- ✅ Submit validation
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Warning about elimination
- ✅ Redirect to shoot-off detail after submission

**UI Design:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Quick Fill All: [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5 Perfect]│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ John Smith                                   │
│ Hawks                                        │
│ Tied Score: 195 pts                          │
│                           [-]  [4]  [+]      │
│                              / 5 max         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Score Submission API

**Path:** `/api/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/rounds/[roundId]/scores/route.ts`

POST endpoint to submit round scores.

**Validation:**
- Scores array required
- User is admin/creator
- Round exists and not completed
- Shoot-off is in progress
- All participants are active
- Scores within valid range (0 to max targets)

**Actions:**
1. Create `ShootOffScore` records for each participant
2. Mark round as `completed: true`
3. Apply elimination logic based on format
4. Return remaining participant count

**Elimination Formats:**

**Sudden Death:**
- Eliminates anyone not tied for highest score
- Immediate elimination each round
- Fastest format

```typescript
const highestScore = Math.max(...scores.map(s => s.targets))
const eliminatedIds = scores
  .filter(s => s.targets < highestScore)
  .map(s => s.participantId)
```

**Fixed Rounds:**
- Placeholder for future implementation
- Would eliminate after predetermined number of rounds
- Currently not fully implemented

**Progressive:**
- Eliminates lowest scorer each round
- Keeps at least 2 participants alive
- More gradual elimination

```typescript
const lowestScore = Math.min(...scores.map(s => s.targets))
const eliminatedIds = scores
  .filter(s => s.targets === lowestScore && scores.length > 2)
  .map(s => s.participantId)
```

### 4. Winner Declaration Page

**Path:** `/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/declare-winner/page.tsx`

Server component for declaring the winner.

**Features:**
- ✅ Authentication & permission checks
- ✅ Validates only 1 active participant remains
- ✅ Prevents declaration if already completed
- ✅ Winner celebration preview
- ✅ Winner statistics display
- ✅ Final standings for all participants
- ✅ Clear UI showing who won and who was eliminated

**Validation Checks:**
1. Shoot-off must be `in_progress`
2. Exactly 1 active participant must remain
3. Winner cannot already be declared
4. User must be admin/creator

### 5. Winner Declaration Form Component

**Path:** `WinnerDeclarationForm.tsx`

Client component for confirming winner.

**Features:**
- ✅ Confirmation checkbox (required)
- ✅ Clear explanation of what happens
- ✅ Winner name prominently displayed
- ✅ Warning about irreversibility
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Success redirect to shoot-off detail

**Confirmation UI:**
```
☑ I confirm that John Smith is the winner of this shoot-off
  This action will mark the shoot-off as completed and update
  the tournament leaderboard. This cannot be undone.

What happens when you declare the winner:
✓ John Smith will be marked as the winner
✓ The shoot-off status will change to "Completed"
✓ Final placements will be assigned to all participants
✓ The tournament leaderboard will be updated (future phase)
```

### 6. Winner Declaration API

**Path:** `/api/tournaments/[id]/shoot-offs/[shootOffId]/declare-winner/route.ts`

POST endpoint to declare the winner.

**Validation:**
- Winner ID required
- User is admin/creator
- Shoot-off is in progress
- Winner is not eliminated
- Winner is only remaining active participant
- Winner not already declared

**Actions:**
1. Calculate total scores for all participants
2. Sort by elimination status and score
3. Assign final placements (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
4. Update all participant records with `finalPlace`
5. Mark shoot-off as `completed`
6. Set `winnerId` and `completedAt`
7. Return updated shoot-off with winner

**Placement Logic:**
```typescript
const sortedParticipants = shootOff.participants
  .map(p => ({
    id: p.id,
    eliminated: p.eliminated,
    totalScore: p.scores.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.targets, 0)
  }))
  .sort((a, b) => {
    // Winner (not eliminated) first
    if (!a.eliminated && b.eliminated) return -1
    if (a.eliminated && !b.eliminated) return 1
    // Then by score descending
    return b.totalScore - a.totalScore
  })

// Assign finalPlace: 1, 2, 3, ...
sortedParticipants.forEach((p, index) => {
  update finalPlace = index + 1
})
```

## Complete User Flow

### 3. Automatic Elimination

### 4. Repeat Until Winner

## Technical Implementation

### Transaction Safety:

Winner declaration uses a transaction to ensure atomicity:

```typescript
await prisma.$transaction([
  ...participantUpdates,  // Update all finalPlace values
  prisma.shootOff.update({  // Mark as completed with winner
    where: { id: shootOffId },
    data: {
      winnerId,
      status: 'completed',
      completedAt: new Date()
    }
  })
])
```

### Score Validation:

```typescript
// Range check
if (score.targets < 0 || score.targets > tournament.shootOffTargetsPerRound) {
  return error
}

// Participant check
const participant = round.shootOff.participants.find(p => p.id === score.participantId)
if (!participant || participant.eliminated) {
  return error
}
```

### Elimination Logic Safety:

```typescript
// Progressive: Keep at least 2 alive
if (eliminatedIds.length > 0 && eliminatedIds.length < scores.length) {
  await prisma.shootOffParticipant.updateMany({
    where: { id: { in: eliminatedIds } },
    data: { eliminated: true }
  })
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Fixed Rounds Format** - Not fully implemented
   - Placeholder in elimination logic
   - Would require tracking round count vs max rounds
   - Future enhancement

2. **No Edit After Submission** - Scores cannot be changed
   - Once round is completed, scores are locked
   - Would need admin override functionality to fix mistakes

3. **Tie Handling in Final Round** - Not implemented
   - If multiple shooters tie in final round, all remain active
   - System won't declare winner until manual elimination
   - Could add tie-breaking rules

## Next Steps

### Phase 6: Leaderboard Integration

Display shoot-off results on the main leaderboard:
1. Show shoot-off badges next to participants
2. Display shoot-off winners in HOA/HAA
3. Show final placements from shoot-offs
4. Integrate with overall rankings

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
