# Disciplines System Guide

## Overview

The Clay Target Tracker now supports multiple shooting disciplines per tournament, allowing shooters to compete in:
- **Sporting Clays**
- **5-Stand**
- **Skeet**
- **Trap**

Shooters can register for multiple disciplines within a single tournament, and their scores are tracked separately for each discipline over time.

### 3. **Score Entry by Discipline**
When entering scores:
- If registered for multiple disciplines, select which discipline to enter scores for
- Each discipline maintains its own score record
- Standard 5-station scoring (targets hit / total targets per station)

**How to enter scores:**
1. Navigate to tournament detail page
2. Click "Enter My Scores"
3. Select discipline (if registered for multiple)
4. Enter targets hit for each of 5 stations
5. Submit scores

### 4. **Leaderboards with Discipline Tabs**
Tournament leaderboards now support discipline filtering:
- **"All Disciplines" tab**: Shows all shoots across all disciplines

**Features:**
- ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰ medals for top 3 finishers

### 5. **Shooter History Page**
New dedicated history page (`/history`) shows:
- Complete shooting history across all tournaments

  - Total number of shoots
  - Total score (targets hit / total possible)
  - Average percentage

## Database Structure

### Core Models

**Discipline** - The four shooting disciplines
- `id`, `name`, `displayName`, `description`
- Seeded on first migration

**TournamentDiscipline** - Links tournaments to available disciplines
- Many-to-many relationship between Tournament and Discipline

**RegistrationDiscipline** - Tracks which disciplines each shooter registered for
- Links Registration to Discipline
- `assignedBy` field tracks if coach assigned or self-selected

**Shoot** - Individual shooting session
- Unique combination of Tournament + Shooter + Discipline
- Links to multiple Score records
- Allows historical tracking of progress

**Score** - Individual station scores
- Links to Shoot (not directly to Tournament/Shooter)
- One score per station per shoot
- Unique constraint on `[shootId, station]`

### Data Flow

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Multi-Discipline Tournament
```typescript
// Tournament with all 4 disciplines
{

  disciplineIds: [
    "sporting_clays_id",
    "five_stand_id",
    "skeet_id",
    "trap_id"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Shooter Registers for Multiple Disciplines
1. Shooter navigates to tournament
2. Clicks "Register for Tournament"
3. Selects: Sporting Clays âœ“, 5-Stand âœ“, Skeet âœ—, Trap âœ—
4. Submits registration
5. Can now enter scores for Sporting Clays and 5-Stand

### Example 3: Coach Bulk Registers Team

## Migration Guide

### Updating Existing Tournaments

If you have existing tournaments without disciplines:

1. **Database seeding** already populated 4 disciplines
2. **Existing tournaments** will need disciplines assigned manually via Prisma Studio or scripts
3. **Existing registrations** will need RegistrationDiscipline entries created
4. **Existing scores** need to be migrated to new Shoot/Score structure

### Manual Fix Script Example
```javascript
// scripts/migrate-existing-data.js
const { prisma } = require('../lib/prisma')

async function migrateData() {
  // Get all tournaments without disciplines
  const tournaments = await prisma.tournament.findMany({
    include: { disciplines: true }
  })
  
  const sportingClays = await prisma.discipline.findUnique({
    where: { name: 'sporting_clays' }
  })
  
  for (const tournament of tournaments) {
    if (tournament.disciplines.length === 0) {
      // Default to Sporting Clays
      await prisma.tournamentDiscipline.create({
        data: {
          tournamentId: tournament.id,
          disciplineId: sportingClays.id
        }
      })
    }
  }
}

migrateData()
```

## Best Practices

### For Tournament Organizers
1. **Always select at least one discipline** when creating tournaments
2. **Consider offering all four disciplines** for larger events
3. **Check registrations by discipline** to ensure balanced participation

### For Coaches
1. **Discuss with shooters** before bulk registering them for disciplines
2. **Use discipline selection thoughtfully** - don't overwhelm shooters
3. **Review team registrations** in the "My Team" page

### For Shooters
1. **Only register for disciplines you plan to shoot**
2. **Enter scores promptly** after completing each discipline
3. **Use "My History" page** to track progress over time
4. **View discipline-specific leaderboards** to see your rankings

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No disciplines available for tournament"
- Tournament organizer didn't select any disciplines
- Contact admin to update tournament configuration

### "Shooter not registered for this discipline"
- Can't enter scores for disciplines not registered for
- Register for additional disciplines (if still open)

### "Scores not appearing in leaderboard"
- Ensure scores were saved successfully
- Refresh the page
- Check correct discipline tab is selected

### "Can't see discipline tabs in leaderboard"
- Tournament only has one discipline (tabs hidden)
- No shoots have been entered yet
