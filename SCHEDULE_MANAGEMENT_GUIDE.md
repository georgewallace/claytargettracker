## üìù Creating Time Slots

### Option 1: Smart Generation (Recommended)

This is the fastest way to create multiple time slots at once.

1. **Click "Generate Time Slots"**
2. **Configure your settings**:
   - **Discipline**: Which event (Sporting Clays, Skeet, etc.)
   - **Date**: Which tournament day
   - **Start Time**: When to begin (e.g., 8:00 AM)
   - **End Time**: When to end (e.g., 5:00 PM)
   - **Slot Duration**: How long each slot (30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3 hrs)
   - **Squad Capacity**: Shooters per squad (typically 5)
   - **Field/Station Number**: Optional location identifier

3. **Preview**: See exactly what time slots will be created
4. **Click "Generate"**

#### Example:
```
Settings:
- Discipline: Sporting Clays
- Date: March 15, 2025
- Start: 08:00
- End: 17:00
- Duration: 2 hours
- Capacity: 5
- Station: Station 1

Result: Creates 4 time slots:
‚Ä¢ 08:00 - 10:00
‚Ä¢ 10:00 - 12:00
‚Ä¢ 12:00 - 14:00
‚Ä¢ 14:00 - 16:00
(Note: 16:00-17:00 slot not created because it's less than 2 hours)
```

### Option 2: Manual Addition

For more control or adding individual slots:

1. **Click "+ Add Time Slot"**
2. **Fill in details**:
   - Date (pre-selected to current day tab)
   - Discipline
   - Start time
   - End time
   - Squad capacity
   - Field/Station number (optional)
   - Notes (optional)
3. **Click "Add Time Slot"**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot delete time slot with existing squads"
**Solution**: Delete all squads in that time slot first, then delete the time slot.

### "Time slot date must be within tournament date range"
**Solution**: Make sure the date you're selecting is between the tournament's start and end dates.

### "Discipline is not part of this tournament"
**Solution**: Only disciplines that were selected when creating/editing the tournament can have time slots.

### Time slots not showing up
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure you're on the correct day tab
2. Check the discipline filter
3. Refresh the page

### "End time must be after start time"
**Solution**: Choose an end time that comes after the start time.
