# 🐛 Bug Fixes: Tournament Creation & Team Join Requests

## Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Prisma Error on Teams Page**
**Error**: `prisma.teamJoinRequest.findMany` was not recognized

**Cause**: Dev server was running with old cached Prisma client that didn't include the new `TeamJoinRequest` model.

**Solution**:
1. Stopped dev server (`pkill -f "next dev"`)
2. Cleared Next.js cache (`rm -rf .next`)
3. Regenerated Prisma client (`npx prisma generate`)
4. Restarted dev server (`npm run dev`)

### **Issue 2: Shooters Can Still Create Tournaments**
**Problem**: Even though the "Create Tournament" button was hidden on the home page, shooters could:
1. See the link in the navbar
2. Navigate directly to `/tournaments/create`

**Causes**:
- Navbar showed "Create Tournament" link to all authenticated users
- Tournament create page had no authorization check

**Solutions**:

#### **1. Protected the Create Tournament Page**
**File**: `app/tournaments/create/page.tsx`

Added authorization check:
```typescript
export default async function CreateTournamentPage() {
  const user = await getCurrentUser()
  
  // Only coaches and admins can create tournaments
  if (!user || (user.role !== 'coach' && user.role !== 'admin')) {
    redirect('/')
  }
  
  // ... rest of page
}
```

#### **2. Fixed Navbar Links**
**File**: `components/Navbar.tsx`

Wrapped "Create Tournament" link in role check (both desktop and mobile):
```typescript
{(user.role === 'coach' || user.role === 'admin') && (
  <>
    <Link href="/tournaments/create">
      Create Tournament
    </Link>
    <Link href="/teams/my-team">
      My Team
    </Link>
  </>
)}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`app/tournaments/create/page.tsx`**
   - Added `getCurrentUser()` call
   - Added role check and redirect
   - Imported `redirect` from `next/navigation`

2. **`components/Navbar.tsx`**
   - Moved "Create Tournament" link inside coach/admin conditional
   - Applied to both desktop and mobile menus
   - Consistent with "My Team" link pattern

## Security Improvements

### **Defense in Depth**
Now using multiple layers of security:

1. **UI Layer**: Hide buttons/links from unauthorized users
2. **Route Layer**: Redirect unauthorized users from protected pages
3. **API Layer**: Already had checks in API routes

### **Unauthorized Access Attempts**
- Direct URL navigation → Redirected to home page
- API calls without auth → 401/403 errors
- Database constraints → Ensure data integrity

## Summary

✅ **Prisma client regenerated** - Teams page now works  
✅ **Tournament creation restricted** - Shooters can't create tournaments  
✅ **Navbar properly restricted** - Links only show to authorized roles  
✅ **Page-level protection** - Direct URL access blocked
