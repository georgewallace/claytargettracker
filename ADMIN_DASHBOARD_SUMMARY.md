## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Uses Next.js App Router with server components
- **Data Fetching**: Parallel queries using `Promise.all()` for optimal performance
- **Authentication**: Protected route with `getCurrentUser()` check
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with efficient queries and aggregations

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel data fetching (all queries execute simultaneously)
- Uses `_count` for efficient counting
- Includes only necessary relations
- Aggregates data at database level
- No client-side JavaScript required for initial render

### Security
- Admin-only access with role validation
- Automatic redirect for non-admin users
- Session-based authentication
- SQL injection protection via Prisma

---

## 📊 Database Queries

The dashboard executes 7 parallel queries:
1. Tournament statistics grouped by status
2. Total shooter count
3. Total team count
4. Coach/admin count
5. 10 most recent registrations (with relations)
6. 10 most recent scores (with relations)
7. All tournaments (with full details)

All queries execute in parallel for optimal performance.
