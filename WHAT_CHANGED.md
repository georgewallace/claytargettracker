## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Tables
1. **Discipline** - The 4 shooting types (pre-seeded)
2. **TournamentDiscipline** - Links tournaments to disciplines
3. **RegistrationDiscipline** - Tracks shooter discipline choices
4. **Shoot** - Individual shooting session (Tournament + Shooter + Discipline)

### Modified Tables
- **Score** - Now links to Shoot (instead of Tournament/Shooter directly)

### Unique Constraints Added
- Tournament + Shooter + Discipline (one shoot per combo)
- Shoot + Station (one score per station per shoot)
- Registration + Discipline (no duplicate discipline registrations)
- Tournament + Discipline (each discipline appears once per tournament)

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Discipline
A shooting type: Sporting Clays, 5-Stand, Skeet, or Trap

### Shoot
A single shooting session = Tournament + Shooter + Discipline
- Example: "John Smith shot Sporting Clays at Spring Championship"
- Contains multiple Score records (one per station)

### Registration with Disciplines
When you register for a tournament, you choose which disciplines to compete in
- Can choose 1, 2, 3, or all 4 (if tournament offers them)
- Tracked as self-selected or coach-assigned

### Historical Tracking
All shoots are preserved, so you can:
- See your progress over time
- Compare performance across disciplines
- Calculate averages and statistics

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to register for all disciplines?**
A: No! Choose only the ones you want to shoot.

**Q: Can I add more disciplines after registering?**
A: Not currently - you'd need to contact the organizer or admin.

**Q: What if a tournament only has one discipline?**
A: The tabs won't show - it'll just display that discipline's leaderboard.

**Q: Can coaches assign different disciplines to different shooters?**
A: Not yet - bulk registration applies same disciplines to all selected shooters.

**Q: Where do I see my shooting history?**
A: Click "My History" in the navbar (visible when logged in).

**Q: Can I filter history by discipline?**
A: Not yet, but you can see which discipline each shoot was for in the table.
