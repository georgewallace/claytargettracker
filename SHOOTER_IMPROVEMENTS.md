## 🎯 **UI Fix: Registration Badge**

### **Problem**
The "✓ Registered" badge was overlapping with the "upcoming" status badge in card view.

### **Solution**
Changed from absolute positioning to flexbox layout:
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-2 items-end">
  <span>upcoming</span>
  <span>✓ Registered</span>
</div>
```

Now badges stack vertically with proper spacing!
