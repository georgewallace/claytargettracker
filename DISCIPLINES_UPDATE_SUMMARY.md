## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migrations

- Added unique constraints
- Seeded 4 disciplines
```

### API Routes
All API routes updated to handle disciplines:

- `POST /api/registrations` - Accepts `disciplineIds[]`
- `POST /api/registrations/bulk` - Accepts `disciplineIds[]`
- `POST /api/shoots` - Creates/updates shoot with scores

## 🧪 Testing Completed

### Manual Testing Scenarios
✅ Create tournament with single discipline
✅ Create tournament with all disciplines
✅ Self-register for one discipline
✅ Self-register for multiple disciplines
✅ Coach bulk register for single discipline
