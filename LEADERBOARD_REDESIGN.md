# Leaderboard Redesign & Score Entry Improvements

## Overview
This update includes major improvements to the score entry system and a complete redesign of the leaderboard to be more compact and data-dense.

## ‚úÖ Score Entry Improvements

### Fixed: Squad Completion Status Bug
**Problem:** When switching from "All Squads" to a single squad in the score entry view, all other squads would show 0% completion status, even if they had scores entered.

**Solution:**
- Added a separate state `allDisciplineScores` that tracks completion status for all shooters in the active discipline
- This state persists regardless of which squad is currently selected
- Completion percentages now remain accurate when switching between squad views

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `allDisciplineScores` state: `Record<string, boolean>` - maps shooterId to whether they have scores
- Added `useEffect` hook to fetch all scores for the active discipline on mount/discipline change
- Updated squad completion calculation to use `allDisciplineScores` instead of the editable `scores` state
- After saving scores, the `allDisciplineScores` state is updated to reflect newly scored shooters

**Files Modified:**
- `app/tournaments/[id]/scores/ScoreEntry.tsx`

## ‚úÖ Leaderboard Redesign

### New Compact Table Format

#### Divisions View (üìä By Division)
**Before:** Large expandable cards for each shooter, divisions displayed vertically one at a time

**After:** Compact table with columns, divisions displayed in a 2-column grid (tiles)

**Features:**
- **Tiled Layout:** Divisions displayed side-by-side (2 columns on large screens)
- **Table Format:** Clean, spreadsheet-like data presentation
- **Columns:**
  - `#` - Rank with medal emojis (ü•á ü•à ü•â) for top 3
  - `Entrant` - Shooter name
  - `Team` - Team affiliation
  - `[Discipline columns]` - One column per tournament discipline showing individual scores
  - `Total` - Total score across all disciplines (highlighted)
- **Compact Headers:** Smaller, cleaner section headers
- **Hover Effects:** Rows highlight on hover for better readability
- **See Everyone:** All divisions visible at once without scrolling or tabbing

#### Squads View (üë• By Squad)
**Before:** Large cards with progress bars and member lists

**After:** Compact table with inline progress indicators

**Features:**
- **Table Format:** Single unified table for all squads
- **Columns:**
  - `#` - Rank with medal emojis
  - `Squad` - Squad name
  - `Team` - Team name or "Mixed"
  - `Members` - Truncated member list (hover to see full)
  - `Status` - Completion badge with inline mini progress bar
  - `Total Score` - Combined squad score (highlighted)
- **Status Indicators:**
  - ‚úì Complete (green badge)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è % (yellow badge with mini progress bar)
  - Incomplete squads have subtle yellow background

### Podium View (üèÜ Podium)
**No changes** - Remains the same championship display with HOA, HAA, Top 3 Individuals, and Top 3 Squads

## üìä Sample Data Added

Added 22 diverse sample shooters across all divisions to the West End tournament:
- **Novice:** 4 shooters
- **Intermediate:** 5 shooters
- **Junior Varsity:** 4 shooters
- **Senior:** 6 shooters
- **College-Trade School:** 3 shooters

Each shooter has:
- Registered for all disciplines (Sporting Clays, Skeet, Trap)
- Assigned to squads across different time slots
- Random scores generated (18-25 per round for variety)

**Total tournament participants:** 48 shooters

## üéØ Benefits

## üîß Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
// Separate completion tracking from editable scores
const [scores, setScores] = useState<Record<string, Record<number, number>>>({})
const [allDisciplineScores, setAllDisciplineScores] = useState<Record<string, boolean>>({})
```

### Completion Tracking
```typescript
// Fetches all scores for discipline on load
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchAllDisciplineScores = async () => {
    // Get all shooters in this discipline's squads
    // Fetch their scores
    // Build completion map: shooterId -> hasScores
    setAllDisciplineScores(completionMap)
  }
  fetchAllDisciplineScores()
}, [activeDiscipline, tournament.id])
```

### Table Structure
```typescript
// Divisions displayed in 2-column grid
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
  {divisions.map((division) => (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>#</th>
          <th>Entrant</th>
          <th>Team</th>
          {tournament.disciplines.map(d => <th>{d.displayName}</th>)}
          <th>Total</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {shooters.map(shooter => (
          <tr>
            {/* Display rank, name, team, scores, total */}
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  ))}
</div>
```

## üöÄ Testing Recommendations

1. **Score Entry:**
   - Select "All Squads" and note completion percentages
   - Switch to a single squad
   - Verify other squads still show correct percentages
   - Enter scores and verify percentages update immediately

2. **Leaderboard:**
   - View "By Division" - verify all divisions show side-by-side
   - Check that discipline columns show correct scores
   - Verify totals are accurate
   - Test "By Squad" table view
   - Verify completion status badges and progress bars

3. **Responsive:**
   - Test on mobile - tables should scroll horizontally
   - Test on tablet - should show 1 or 2 columns as appropriate
   - Test on desktop - should show 2 columns for divisions

## üìà Performance

- No performance impact - same number of calculations
- Slightly faster initial load due to single fetch for all scores
- Tables render faster than expandable cards
- CSS-only hover effects (no JavaScript)
