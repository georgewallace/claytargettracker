# 🎯 Discipline Tabs & Time Overlap Detection - Complete

## ✅ **All Features Implemented!**

This document outlines the major enhancements to the squad management system to support multiple disciplines and prevent scheduling conflicts.

---

## 🚀 **New Features**

### **1. Discipline Tabs** 🎨
The squad management page now has tabs for each discipline, making it much easier to navigate and organize squads.

#### **Visual Layout**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Trap 4] [Skeet 3] [Sporting Clays 5] [5-Stand 2]    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    Active tab highlighted in blue
    Badge shows number of squads per discipline
```

#### **How It Works**
- **Automatic tabs** created based on tournament disciplines
- **Badge shows squad count** for each discipline
- **Click to switch** between disciplines
- **Only shows time slots** for selected discipline
- **Filters unassigned shooters** by discipline

#### **Benefits**
- ✅ Cleaner, more organized interface
- ✅ Focus on one discipline at a time
- ✅ Easy to see which disciplines need attention
- ✅ Reduces visual clutter
- ✅ Faster navigation

---

### **2. Multi-Discipline Squad Assignments** 🎯
Shooters can now be assigned to squads in **multiple disciplines**!

#### **Previous Behavior**
- ❌ Once assigned to any squad, shooter considered "assigned"
- ❌ Couldn't add to other disciplines
- ❌ Had to manage manually

#### **New Behavior**
- ✅ Shooter can be in one squad per discipline
- ✅ Trap squad + Skeet squad + Sporting Clays squad = OK!
- ✅ Unassigned list shows per discipline
- ✅ More flexible scheduling

#### **Example**
```
Shooter: John Doe
  - Trap: Squad A (08:00-10:00)
  - Skeet: Squad B (10:30-12:30)
  - Sporting Clays: Squad C (13:00-15:00)
  - 5-Stand: Unassigned ← Shows in unassigned when on 5-Stand tab
```

---

### **3. Time Overlap Warnings** ⚠️
The system now detects and warns you when assigning a shooter to overlapping time slots!

#### **When Triggered**
The warning appears when:
1. Dragging a shooter to a squad
2. The shooter is already in another squad
3. The time slots overlap on the same date

#### **Warning Dialog**
```
⚠️ TIME CONFLICT WARNING

This shooter is already assigned to:
• Trap - 08:00 to 10:00 (Squad A)
• Skeet - 09:00 to 11:00 (Squad B)

These times overlap with 09:30 to 11:30.

Continue anyway?
[Cancel] [OK]
```

#### **Overlap Detection Logic**
```
Same Date?  ✓
Times overlap if:
  (NewStart < ExistingEnd) AND (NewEnd > ExistingStart)

Examples:
  08:00-10:00 overlaps with 09:00-11:00 ✓ (conflict!)
  08:00-10:00 overlaps with 10:00-12:00 ✗ (no conflict)
  08:00-10:00 overlaps with 11:00-13:00 ✗ (no conflict)
```

#### **Features**
- ✅ Shows all conflicting squads
- ✅ Displays discipline, time, and squad name
- ✅ Allows override if needed
- ✅ Prevents accidental double-booking
- ✅ Works for both existing squads and new squad creation

## 🎨 **UI Improvements**

### **Discipline Tabs**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                │
│  Trap [4]     Skeet [3]    Sporting Clays [5]   5-Stand [2]  │
│  ─────────                                                     │
│  Active tab has blue underline and darker text               │
│  Badge shows squad count in colored pill                      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Stats Updated**
Stats now show **per-discipline** numbers:
- Total Shooters (all registered)
- Unassigned (for active discipline only)
- Time Slots (for active discipline only)
- Squads (for active discipline only)

### **Unassigned List**
- Filtered by active discipline
- Shows only shooters not assigned in THIS discipline
- Can be in other disciplines

## 📋 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified**

**`app/tournaments/[id]/squads/SquadManager.tsx`**

#### **1. Discipline Tab State**
```typescript
const [activeDiscipline, setActiveDiscipline] = useState<string | null>(null)

// Get unique disciplines
const tournamentDisciplines = Array.from(
  new Set(tournament.timeSlots.map(slot => slot.disciplineId))
).map(disciplineId => {
  const slot = tournament.timeSlots.find(s => s.disciplineId === disciplineId)
  return slot?.discipline
}).filter(Boolean)
```

#### **2. Per-Discipline Assignment Check**
```typescript
const isShooterAssignedInDiscipline = (shooterId: string, disciplineId: string) => {
  return tournament.timeSlots
    .filter(slot => slot.disciplineId === disciplineId)
    .some(slot => slot.squads.some((squad: any) => 
      squad.members.some((member: any) => member.shooterId === shooterId)
    ))
}
```

#### **3. Time Overlap Detection**
```typescript
const hasTimeOverlap = (shooterId: string, newTimeSlot: any) => {
  const shooterSquads = getShooterSquads(shooterId)
  const overlapping: any[] = []
  
  for (const squadInfo of shooterSquads) {
    const existingSlot = squadInfo.timeSlot
    
    // Check same date
    if (sameDate(existingSlot.date, newTimeSlot.date)) {
      // Check time overlap
      if (newStart < existingEnd && newEnd > existingStart) {
        overlapping.push(squadInfo)
      }
    }
  }
  
  return {hasOverlap: overlapping.length > 0, overlappingSlots: overlapping}
}
```

#### **4. Overlap Warning in Drag Handler**
```typescript
if (timeSlot) {
  const overlapCheck = hasTimeOverlap(shooterId, timeSlot)
  
  if (overlapCheck.hasOverlap) {
    const overlapInfo = overlapCheck.overlappingSlots.map(info => {
      return `• ${info.timeSlot.discipline.displayName} - ${info.timeSlot.startTime} to ${info.timeSlot.endTime} (${info.name})`
    }).join('\n')
    
    if (!confirm(`⚠️ TIME CONFLICT WARNING\n\n...`)) {
      return // Cancel assignment
    }
  }
}
```
