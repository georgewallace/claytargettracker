# Shoot-Off System - Implementation Status

## ✅ Phase 1: Database Schema - COMPLETED

### What Was Implemented

#### Tournament Model Updates
Added 6 new shoot-off configuration fields to `Tournament` model:

```prisma
// Shoot-Off Configuration
enableShootOffs          Boolean @default(true)   // Enable/disable shoot-offs
shootOffTriggers         String?                  // JSON: when to trigger (e.g., ["podium", "top5"])
shootOffFormat           String  @default("sudden_death") // sudden_death, fixed_rounds, progressive
shootOffTargetsPerRound  Int     @default(2)      // Targets per round
shootOffStartStation     String?                  // Discipline-specific start station
shootOffRequiresPerfect  Boolean @default(false)  // Only for perfect scores
```

#### New Database Models

1. **ShootOff** - Main shoot-off record
   - Links to Tournament and Discipline
   - Tracks status (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
   - Records format, start/end times, winner
   - Has many Participants and Rounds

2. **ShootOffParticipant** - Shooters in the shoot-off
   - Links to ShootOff and Shooter
   - Tracks original tied score
   - Records final placement after shoot-off
   - Tracks elimination status and round

3. **ShootOffRound** - Individual rounds within a shoot-off
   - Sequential round numbers
   - Configurable target count
   - Optional station and difficulty settings
   - Has many Scores (one per participant)

4. **ShootOffScore** - Individual shooter's score per round
   - Links to Round and Participant
   - Records targets hit vs total targets
   - Optional performance notes

### Database Changes Applied

- ✅ Updated both SQLite and PostgreSQL schemas
- ✅ Applied changes to local database (`npm run db:push`)
- ✅ Created migration: `20251029152759_add_shootoff_system`
- ✅ Applied migration to staging database
- ✅ Generated updated Prisma client

### Migration File Created

```sql
-- Tournament table alterations (6 new fields)
-- CREATE TABLE "ShootOff" (12 fields, 2 indexes)
-- CREATE TABLE "ShootOffParticipant" (7 fields, 2 indexes, 1 unique constraint)
-- CREATE TABLE "ShootOffRound" (8 fields, 1 index, 1 unique constraint)
-- CREATE TABLE "ShootOffScore" (6 fields, 2 indexes, 1 unique constraint)
-- All foreign key constraints added
```

## 📋 Remaining Phases

### Phase 2: Tournament Settings UI (Next Step)
**Status:** Ready to implement
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

#### Files to Update:
1. `app/tournaments/create/page.tsx`
   - Add shoot-off configuration section
   - Checkboxes for triggers (1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place, etc.)
   - Format dropdown (sudden death, fixed rounds, progressive)
   - Targets per round input
   - Station configuration (if applicable)

2. `app/tournaments/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
   - Same UI as create page
   - Pre-populate existing settings

#### UI Wireframe:
```
┌─ Shoot-Off Configuration ──────────────────┐
│ ☑ Enable Shoot-Offs                        │
│                                             │
│ Trigger shoot-offs when tied for:          │
│ ☑ 1st Place    ☐ 4th Place                 │
│ ☑ 2nd Place    ☐ 5th Place                 │
│ ☑ 3rd Place    ☐ Perfect Scores Only       │
│                                             │
│ Format: [Sudden Death ▾]                    │
│ Targets per round: [2]                      │
│ Start station: [Station 4 (Optional)]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🎯 Ready to Use Now

The database schema is complete and ready. You can:

1. **Query shoot-off data** using Prisma:
   ```typescript
   const shootOffs = await prisma.shootOff.findMany({
     where: { tournamentId },
     include: {
       participants: {
         include: { shooter: { include: { user: true } } }
       },
       rounds: {
         include: { scores: true }
       },
       winner: { include: { user: true } }
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Create shoot-offs** programmatically:
   ```typescript
   const shootOff = await prisma.shootOff.create({
     data: {
       tournamentId: 'xxx',
       position: 1, // 1st place tie
       format: 'sudden_death',
       description: '1st Place Shoot-Off - Trap',
       participants: {
         create: [
           { shooterId: 'shooter1', tiedScore: 98 },
           { shooterId: 'shooter2', tiedScore: 98 }
         ]
       }
     }
   })
   ```

3. **Access new Tournament fields**:
   ```typescript
   const tournament = await prisma.tournament.findUnique({
     where: { id },
     include: { shootOffs: true }
   })
   
   if (tournament.enableShootOffs) {
     // Shoot-offs are enabled for this tournament
     const triggers = JSON.parse(tournament.shootOffTriggers || '[]')
     // triggers might be: ["podium", "top5", "perfect"]
   }
   ```

## 📚 Documentation

Complete implementation plan: `SHOOTOFF_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Flexible Trigger System**: JSON array allows multiple trigger types
2. **Round-based Scoring**: Supports both sudden death and fixed rounds
3. **Discipline-Specific**: Can configure different settings per discipline
4. **Historical Data**: All rounds and scores preserved
5. **Cascade Deletes**: Shoot-offs deleted when tournament is deleted

### Example Workflows

#### Simple 2-Way Tie for 1st Place
1. Tournament ends, two shooters both have 98/100
2. Admin clicks "Initiate Shoot-Off" on leaderboard
3. System creates shoot-off with both participants
4. Admin enters scores for Round 1: both 2/2 → continue
5. Round 2: Shooter A 2/2, Shooter B 1/2 → Shooter A wins
6. Leaderboard updates: Shooter A = 1st, Shooter B = 2nd

#### 3-Way Tie for 3rd Place
1. Three shooters tied at 88/100
2. Admin creates shoot-off for 3rd place
3. Round 1: A=2/2, B=2/2, C=1/2 → C eliminated (confirmed 4th)
4. Round 2: A=2/2, B=2/2 → continue
5. Round 3: A=2/2, B=1/2 → A wins
6. Final: A=2nd, B=3rd, C=4th

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Implement Full Feature (Recommended)
Continue with Phases 2-7 in sequence for complete shoot-off system.

### Option 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Implement just enough for basic functionality:
1. Phase 2: Add settings to tournament form
2. Basic API to manually create shoot-offs
3. Simple score entry page
4. Skip auto-detection and full UI

### Option 3: Pause and Test Schema
Leave schema in place, implement other features, return to this later.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Database is Ready**: No more schema changes needed for basic functionality
2. **Migration Applied**: Staging database has shoot-off tables
3. **Prisma Client Updated**: All TypeScript types available
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Existing tournaments work fine (enableShootOffs defaults to true)
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All new fields are optional or have defaults

## 📊 Effort Estimation

- **Phase 1: Database Schema** - ✅ DONE (2 hours)
- **Phase 2: Tournament Settings** - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 3: Detection & Creation** - 3-4 hours
- **Phase 4: Management Interface** - 4-5 hours
- **Phase 5: Score Entry** - 3-4 hours
- **Phase 6: Leaderboard Integration** - 2-3 hours
- **Phase 7: Testing & Polish** - 2-3 hours

**Total Remaining**: 16-22 hours for complete implementation

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

- **Admin Only**: Only admins/tournament creators can manage shoot-offs
- **Mobile Friendly**: All interfaces must work on mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Live score updates during shoot-off
- **Clear Status**: Visual indicators for pending/active/complete
- **Historical View**: Ability to review past shoot-offs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases

## Questions to Consider

Before continuing implementation:

1. **Priority**: Is this high priority or can it wait?
2. **MVP vs Full**: Do you want full feature or MVP first?
3. **Auto vs Manual**: Should ties auto-create shoot-offs or require admin action?
4. **Notifications**: Should participants be notified of shoot-offs? (future)
5. **Live Scoring**: Real-time updates vs page refresh?
6. **Mobile First**: Build mobile interface first or desktop?

---
