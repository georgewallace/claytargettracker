## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd claytargettracker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env.local file
cp .env .env.local

# .env.local should contain:
# DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
# STAGING_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." (if deploying)
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
# Initialize local SQLite database
npm run db:push
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### First-Time Setup

Create an admin account to get started:
1. Sign up at `/signup`
2. Your first account is automatically granted admin role
3. Create teams, tournaments, and manage shooters

## Database Schema

### Models

- **User**: Authentication and user information
- **Shooter**: Shooter profile linked to user
- **Team**: Team information
- **Tournament**: Tournament details and metadata
- **Registration**: Links shooters to tournaments
- **Score**: Individual station scores for shooters

### Relationships

- Users have one Shooter profile
- Shooters can belong to one Team (optional)
- Tournaments have many Registrations and Scores
- Shooters have many Registrations and Scores

## Key Features Explained

### Tournament Workflow

1. **Create Tournament**: Authenticated users can create tournaments with name, location, date, and description
2. **Register**: Shooters register for upcoming tournaments
3. **Enter Scores**: Registered shooters enter scores for each station (typically 5 stations)
4. **View Results**: Leaderboards automatically calculate and rank shooters by total score

### Score Entry

- Default: 5 stations, 25 targets each (customizable)
- Input validation ensures scores don't exceed total targets
- Real-time calculation of totals and percentages
- Scores can be updated after initial entry

### Team System

- Teams are optional - shooters can compete independently
- Each shooter can be on one team at a time
- Teams are displayed in leaderboards and registrations
- Easy team creation and membership management

## Development

### Database Workflow

This project uses a **dual-database approach**:
- **SQLite** for local development (fast, no setup)
- **PostgreSQL** for staging and production (robust, scalable)

#### Local Development

```bash
# Push schema changes to local SQLite
npm run db:push

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:studio

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

#### Deploying to Staging

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** When deploying schema changes to staging:

```bash
# 1. Create migration files
npm run db:create:migration your_feature_name

# 2. Apply to staging database
npm run db:migrate:staging

# 3. Commit migration files
git add prisma/migrations/
git commit -m "Add database migration: your_feature_name"

# 4. Deploy to staging
git push origin staging
```
