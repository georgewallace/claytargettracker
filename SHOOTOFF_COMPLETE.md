## 🎓 Elimination Formats Explained

### Sudden Death
**Best for:** Quick resolution, high-pressure situations
- Each round, anyone not tied for the highest score is eliminated
- Can eliminate multiple shooters per round
- Fastest format - often resolves in 1-2 rounds
- Example: Round 1 scores: 5, 5, 4, 3 → Eliminates the 4 and 3

### Progressive
**Best for:** More fair, gives everyone multiple chances
- Each round, the lowest scorer(s) are eliminated
- Only eliminates 1-2 shooters per round (keeps at least 2 alive)
- More rounds, more shooting
- Example: Round 1 scores: 5, 4, 3 → Eliminates the 3

### Fixed Rounds
**Best for:** Predetermined number of rounds (future implementation)
- Shoot a set number of rounds (e.g., 3 rounds)
- Highest total score after all rounds wins
- No elimination until the end
- Currently placeholder - to be fully implemented
